# Predictive-modeling-using-logistic-regression

The data source for this project is the patient network and real-time research platform-PatientsLikeMe. Through the network, patients connect with others who have the same disease or condition and track and share their own experiences.
The scope of our project is to create a predictive model using logistic regression and predict the accuracy and relevance of future posts
based on the attributes of the user who is posting it. This way we can eliminate the dependency on physicians to find the relevance and accuracy of a post.
